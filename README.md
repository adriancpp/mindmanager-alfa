Mindmanager is my hobby project created with

codeigniter 4

php 8.1


Idea of project, was to give possibility to make streak from things which i do everyday.
Later i added option to generate charts which is great for example, to put there your weight when 
you are on a diet


Example of how to use - with enabled chart:

1. create account

2. add new routine with type: Ilość    <-- yeah, translation is on going

"Próg zaliczenia", "Sort" and "Priorytet" dont have matter for now

3. Save changes, and go back to Dashboard

4. u will see there your new routine - when u will add some numbers in input and click [Zapisz]

after clicking Charts tab, u will see your new chart which will grow up with your daily given data
